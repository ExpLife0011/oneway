Bill and Christina,
I've got a Windows version of packet generator working now. It works
on my XP. Please help to test it before I make it available to other people
(but it seems you are my only customers so far.)

To download:
http://72.52.66.12/mc/win-pa2/win-pa2.exe

Run "win-pa2.exe -h" to see usage. Currently it only supports TCP.
The usage is similar to win-pa, but you need to specify a network
interface with "-i" option. It will print the list of available interfaces.
