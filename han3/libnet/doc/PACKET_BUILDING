    ADDING A NEW PACKET BUILDER

    Adding a new packet building module is usually pretty simple.  It depends
    completely on the complexity of the protocol.  The following document
    shows you how to add a packet builder for a simple protocol with a
    static header size, but these concepts can be extended to a complex 
    protocol also.

    1) Start by defining your protocol header format:

    struct XXX_hdr
    {
        u_char  field1;
        u_short field2;
        u_long  field3;
    };

    3) Then work from the following template:

#if (HAVE_CONFIG_H)
#include "../include/config.h"
#endif
#include "../include/libnet.h"


libnet_ptag_t
libnet_build_XXX(u_char arg1, u_short arg2, u_long arg3, u_char *payload,
            u_long payload_s, libnet_t *l, libnet_ptag_t ptag)
{
    /*
     *  n is the size of the protocol unit.  This is usually the header size
     *  plus the payload size.  This is also how many bytes are allocated on
     *  the heap to hold this protocol unit.
     */
    u_long n;

    /*
     *  h is used inside the pblock structure to let libnet know how big
     *  much data to checksum.  This is different for different protocols.
     *  The IPv4 checksum covers the IP header only, while TCP and UDP
     *  checksums cover header and data.
     */
    u_short h;

    /*
     *  p will be used to refer to the protocol block that will either be
     *  allocated if the function's pt argument is 0, or located if ptag refers
     *  to a previously created protocol unit.
     */
    libnet_pblock_t *p;

    /*
     *  XXX_hdr is the header structure that will be overlaid onto the
     *  allocated memory by way of a memcpy.
     */
    struct libnet_XXX_hdr XXX_hdr;

    /*
     *  Here we sanity check to make sure we have a live l.
     */
    if (l == NULL)
    { 
        return (-1);
    }

    n = LIBNET_XXX_H + payload_s;
    h = 0;          /* no checksum by default */

    /*
     *  Find the existing protocol block if a ptag is specified, or create
     *  a new one.
     */
    p = libnet_pblock_probe(l, pt, n, LIBNET_PBLOCK_XXX_H);
    if (p == NULL)
    {
        return (-1);
    }

    /*
     *  Build your packet here.  Be sure to call appropriate endian conversion
     *  routines.
     */
    XXX_hdr.field1 = arg1;
    XXX_hdr.field2 = htons(arg2);
    XXX_hdr.field3 = htonl(arg3);

    /*
     *  Appened the protocol unit to the list.
     */
    n = libnet_pblock_append(l, p, (u_char *)&XXX_hdr, LIBNET_XXX_H);
    if (n == -1)
    {
        goto bad;
    }

    /*
     *  Append the payload to the list if it exists.
     */
    if (payload && payload_s)
    {
        n = libnet_pblock_append(l, p, payload, payload_s);
        if (n == -1)
        {
            goto bad;
        }
    }

    /*
     *  If this packet header has a checksum field, you'll add this
     *  and you'll have to edit libnet_checksum.c to add it to the switch
     *  table.  You might have to define the protocol number too.
     */
    if (sum == 0 && l->injection_type != LIBNET_RAW4)
    {
        /*
         *  If checksum is zero, by default libnet will compute a checksum
         *  for the user.  The programmer can override this by calling
         *  libnet_toggle_checksum(l, ptag, 1);
         */
        libnet_pblock_setflags(p, LIBNET_PBLOCK_DO_CHECKSUM);
    }

    /*
     *  Update the protocol block's meta information and return the protocol
     *  tag id of this pblock.  This tag will be used to locate the pblock
     *  in order to modify the protocol header in subsequent calls.
     */
    return (pt ? pt : libnet_pblock_update(l, p, h, LIBNET_PBLOCK_XXX_H));
bad:
    libnet_pblock_free(p);
    return (-1);

}
