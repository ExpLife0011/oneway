      How Netinstall Works
      --------------------
9/25/2008

1. Server: runs dhcp server, to listen to dhcp broadcast from client. 
   Assigns IP address to client according to its MAC addr pre-captured.

   DHCP server's config entry: 

  next-server 38.105.86.22;
        filename "pxelinux.0";

  tells client to download "pxelinux.0" from tftp server 38.105.86.22. 


2. Client: BIOS configured to do PXE boot. 
   -> starts up
   -> broadcasts dhcp requests
   -> gets response
   -> configures networking
   -> downloads "pxelinux.0" via tftp

3. Client: 
   -> loads and execute boot loader "pxelinux.0" 
   -> via tftp, search for boot config file under "pxelinux.cfg/"
      using its own IP address in upper case hexadecimal. 
   -> downloads kickstart file from the entry: 
      ks=http://38.105.86.22/ks/ks.cfg.se.php?dir=centos4.6&disk=s
      in the config file. 

4. Client: installs OS according to ks file.
