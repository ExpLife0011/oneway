thread-http.py:
  It branches off a thread to simulate sensors (sensor collection service), 
which report data to activeMQ's topic: LISW.SCS. Any client subscribed to 
this topic can get the sensor data from this URL:  

http://192.239.84.155:18080/activemq-web-demo/message/LISW/SCS?timeout=10000&type=topic

  This program also subscribes topc LISW.SPS to receive any notification
regarding sensor planning service. A notification can be sent with this URL: 

 wget -O tmp.out --post-data='' http://localhost:18080/activemq-web-demo/message/LISW/SPS?type=topic\&body=abc

thread-http.py is evolved into "scs-sps.py", which now supports
two way interaction. The web frontwend is ~/webapp/lisw-demo.html.
